00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:04,400
So to summarize, we're not just interested in whether a string is in

1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,110
the language of a particular context-free grammar, we need to have a Parse Tree for

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:15,290
that string. And, a derivation defines a Parse Tree but it turns out that one Parse

3
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:20,509
Tree in general has many derivations and in particular, we're interested in the

4
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:24,919
leftmost and rightmost derivations. These are the two kinds of derivations that are

5
00:00:24,919 --> 00:00:27,259
important in parser implementations.
