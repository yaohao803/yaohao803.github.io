To summarize this video, register allocation is one of the most important jobs that a compiler

1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,740
performs. And it's really, these days they must have an any kind of reasonable

2
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:15,499
production compiler. And, the reason you need it is because the inter-media

3
00:00:15,499 --> 00:00:19,320
code just generally uses too many temporaries. We're allowed to be a little

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,240
bit sloppy with intermediate code precisely because we have good register allocation

5
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,640
algorithms. And the other reason, registers are just a very important

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,750
resource in making good user registers. Having some procedure for making

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,879
efficient use of the registers. Leads to much, much better code in the end,

8
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:41,659
much more efficient code. Now. The register allocation algorithm I described

9
00:00:41,659 --> 00:00:47,960
here is really targeted at risk machine. So, for risk machine reduce instruction set

10
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,089
computer what kind of machine. You can pretty much take the register allocation algorithm

11
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:57,319
that I described and if any for those machines it would work out of the box.

12
00:00:57,319 --> 00:01:02,339
CISC machines - which stands for complex instructions for computers - often

13
00:01:02,339 --> 00:01:07,840
have restrictions on how the register can be used. Certain operation can only work with

14
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:11,250
certain registers. You may have register to different sizes that can only

15
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:16,420
hold certain values. And so it becomes more complicated to register allocation for

16
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:21,140
such machines. What people have done is to adapt the graph coloring procedure that

17
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:27,420
I described here. So, the basic idea is exactly the same and you would recognize

18
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,650
those algorithms is being primarily the graph color algorithms that

19
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:36,750
we discussed. There are just additional. Steps in those algorithms and places where

20
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,340
the particular constraints are what registers can be used have to be observed.
