To wrap up and summarize our discussion of the global analysis of control flow graphs,

1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,050
we've talked about two kinds of analysis in the past several videos. Constant

2
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:15,190
propagation is what is called a forwards analysis Because information is pushed

3
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,910
from the inputs to the outputs. So if you think about a control flow graph. What

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:23,440
happens in control flow analysis is that information flows in this direction.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,710
It flows in the same direction as computation. If I have a constant up here

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:32,780
x is assigned constant down here, and x is used later on and that constant will flow

7
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:38,019
forward to the uses. Okay So information flows in the same direction as computation.

8
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:42,569
Liveness on the other hand is a backwards analysis. Information is pushed

9
00:00:42,569 --> 00:00:48,589
from outputs back towards inputs. So here in this example and let me change

10
00:00:48,589 --> 00:00:55,589
colors. Here we see that x is live before the statement. And that liveness gets propagated

11
00:00:55,749 --> 00:00:59,709
in the other direction. It gets propagated against the control, against the

12
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:06,709
flow, of execution, backwards towards the beginning of the program.

13
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:11,789
So they're many other kinds of global flow analysis in the literature. The

14
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:15,579
constant propagation analysis and the liveness analysis are two of the most important.

15
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:18,049
There is a number of others that are also very important and many, many

16
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:22,469
more that people have investigated. Almost all these analyses can be classified

17
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,950
as either forward or backward. There are some analyses and some important

18
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:30,380
ones that are neither forward nor backward. That information is basically pushed

19
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:34,469
in both directions. And the other thing is that the, almost all the analyses

20
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:38,729
in the literature that do global flow analysis anyway also follow this methodology

21
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:43,619
of local Rules that relay information between adjacent program points.

22
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:47,780
So it, it's the local rules part that's important. So we break down the complicate

23
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,219
d problem of analyzing an entire control flow graph into a collection

24
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:55,939
of rules that only do ver, propagate information very, very locally.
