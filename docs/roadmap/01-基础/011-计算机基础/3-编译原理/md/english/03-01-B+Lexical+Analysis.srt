To summarize, lexical analysis implementation has to do two things. The first

1
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:11,089
job is to recognize the substrings in the input that correspond to tokens. And

2
00:00:11,089 --> 00:00:16,690
here's a little bit of compiler lingo these substrings are called the lexemes. So

3
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,920
the words of the program are called the lexemes. And then the second job is at for

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,369
each lexeme we have to identify its token class. And then the output of the lexical

5
00:00:28,369 --> 00:00:35,369
analyzer is a series of pairs which are the token class. And lexing, Okay, And this

6
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,750
whole thing, one of these pairsis called A token.
