00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:03,679
So now, let's move on to the least upper bound operation. And once again, T and

1
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:08,500
T prime will be any types except self-type. The least upper bound of self-type

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,530
with itself is just self-type, and I think that that's pret ty clear. The

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:17,550
least upper bound of self-types of C and T will be the least upper bound of the class

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,300
C and T. And once again, this is because C is the largest type, that self-type could

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:28,180
be. And therefore, the largest type is guaranteed to cover both self-types of C.

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:35,180
And T is going to be the least upper bound of C and T. And least of our bounds is the

7
00:00:35,339 --> 00:00:41,449
symmetric operations, so if I reverse these two arguments, the answer is the same.

8
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:44,649
And finally if self-type is not one of the arguments at least upper bound then

9
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:48,809
we just do what we do before. The self-type, the least upper bound definition

10
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:53,719
excuse me, has not changed for class names for type names other than self-type.
