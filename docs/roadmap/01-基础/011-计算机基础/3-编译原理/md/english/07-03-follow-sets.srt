00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:07,100
In this video, we're going to continue our discussion of the construction of

1
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:14,100
[laugh](1) parsing tables by taking a look at how we build the follow sets. So here's

2
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:21,860
the definition of follow of x, and recall that the follow set for a given symbol in

3
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:26,439
the grammar isn't really about what that symbol can generate, really, doesn't

4
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:29,989
depend necessarily at all on what the symbol can generate. It depends on where

5
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:34,570
that symbol can appear, where that symbol is used in the grammar. And we say that t

6
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:40,760
is in the follow of x if there is some place in the grammar, some derivation,

7
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:44,530
where that terminal t can appear immediately after the symbol x. Okay, so

8
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:51,530
for all such. E. They make up the follow set of x. And here's some intuition about

9
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,069
how we would compute follow sets. Let's say we have a situation where X goes to

10
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:04,069
two symbols A, B, right? And then anything that B can produce in the first position

11
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:11,290
will clearly be in the follow of A. So if we have X goes to AB. And then through

12
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:21,510
some more, steps, we can get something like, this A goes, B goes to T beta, then

13
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,960
we have a situation where the T comes immediately after the A, and so clearly,

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,350
something that was in the first of B, is in the follow of A. So, so the basic rule

15
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,520
is that you have two symbols that are adjunct somewhere, the first of the second

16
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,520
one is in the follow of the first one. Hm, now Another interesting effect here is

17
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,250
that, if we have, a symbol at the end of a production. Let's take a look at the B

18
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:57,640
here for a moment, okay? And a claim here that anything that's in the follow of the

19
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,100
left hand side is gonna be in the follow of B. In this case, that the follow of X

20
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:06,110
is a subset of the follow of B. And let's take a look at that. Let's say that we

21
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:10,619
have, a situation where we have a derivation from the start symbol, okay? We

22
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:15,700
wind up with X followed by T. It can, it can be other stuff around the [inaudible]

23
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,709
let's ignore that for the moment, let's just focus on the XT. Then we can use this

24
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:26,709
production X goes to AB and in one step we can get to ABT. And then we see T was in

25
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,590
the follow of X a nd also, T is in the follow of B as a result, Okay. So,

26
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:38,319
anything in the follow of X would also be in the follow of B. And we can generalize

27
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,629
this observation about what occurs at the end of a production. So anything that

28
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:45,849
occurs at the end of the production, it, its follow set will include the follow set

29
00:02:45,849 --> 00:02:49,810
of the symbol on the left hand side of the production. Well, what is the end of the

30
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:56,749
production? If, if B can go to epsilon, if B can disappear, then A will appear at the

31
00:02:56,749 --> 00:03:00,810
end of the production. Okay, so if B can go to epsilon, then it will also happen

32
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:07,019
that the follow of X, would be in the follow of A. And following up here in our

33
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,090
example, so we. Or up here we start with the start symbol. We got to XT. In one

34
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:17,469
step we got to ABT and so T was in the follow of B. But now, B can go into

35
00:03:17,469 --> 00:03:24,469
epsilon and so we can also get to AT and therefore T is also in the follow of A.

36
00:03:26,109 --> 00:03:29,719
And finally there's one special case. Remember that we have our special symbol

37
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:35,069
marking the end of the input, and what can that follow? Well the end of the input is

38
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:39,469
in the follow of the start symbol, alright? And this is just a way again of

39
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:44,159
keeping track of what we're going to do when we run out of input. And we'll see

40
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:49,099
how that's used when we built the parsing tables but we always add as an initial

41
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:56,099
condition, that dollar sign is in the follow of the start symbol. So now, let's

42
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:01,599
take a look at and sketch of the algorithm for computing follows. So that's, as we

43
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,939
just said, the dollar sign is in the follow of the start symbol. And now we

44
00:04:07,939 --> 00:04:13,609
take a look at each production. Okay, A goes to alpha X beta, we're, we're

45
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:17,049
focusing here on the X. Okay, if we look at every production and we look at every

46
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:24,049
symbol on the right hand side of that production. And the first of beta, okay,

47
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:30,500
the thing that can follow x in this in this production, the first of that will be

48
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:35,199
in the follow of x, and also we just subtract out epsilon if it was in the

49
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,990
first sub-beta. We're not interested anymore in the epsilons for the purposes

50
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:44,620
of follow sites, epsilon never appears in follow sites, so follow sites are always

51
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:50,840
just sets of terminals. And now the second part of the algorithm is it if we have

52
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,150
some suffix of a production beta that can go to Epsilon, so Epsilon is in the first

53
00:04:55,150 --> 00:05:00,270
beta. Alright, this suffix of the production can completely disappear, then

54
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,409
as we saw on the previous slide the follow of left hand side symbol will be in the

55
00:05:05,409 --> 00:05:12,409
follow of X. And that's it in terms of the rules for computing follow sets. So now

56
00:05:14,009 --> 00:05:18,750
let's work through an example. So here's our grammar again. And we're going to

57
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:24,379
compute, the follow sets for each of the symbols of the grammar. So let's begin,

58
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:30,009
with the, with the start symbol. We'll start with the follow of E. And by

59
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:36,690
definition, we know that dollar is in the follow of E. So we get that one easily.

60
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,370
And now the question is what else could be in the follow of E, Alright? So in order

61
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:45,039
to figure that out we have to look at where E is used in the grammar, Alright?

62
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:51,330
So remember always at follow sets are about where the symbol is used. Not what

63
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:58,330
it produces. Alright? So here. Is a place where E is used, and we can see that it is

64
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:04,220
merely followed by a terminal symbol, so certainly close paren is in the follow of

65
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:09,639
E, right? And there's one other place where E is used, and that's over here. And

66
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,830
it appears that the right end of the production, and so then we know that

67
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:18,569
anything that's in the follow of X is also gonna be in the follow of E. And that's a

68
00:06:18,569 --> 00:06:23,289
constraint, and so we'll right that down over here 'coz this is just a property of

69
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:29,199
the relationship. That the follow sets, will have when we're done computing them.

70
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:34,189
This doesn't immediately tell us anything new that's in the follow of E. But we know

71
00:06:34,189 --> 00:06:38,039
that as we go along, and we learn about things that are in the follow of X, we'll

72
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:42,849
have to add them to the follow of E. And let me just divide up. The slide here so

73
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:46,310
we will put our properties that we know about relationships between fallocates

74
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:50,099
over on the left hand side and we'll put the actual fallocates over here on the

75
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:54,930
right side. So, now to make, that's the only two places, those are the only two pl

76
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:59,659
aces where E is used in the grammar and to make further progress we need to know

77
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:03,969
something about the follow of X. Okay, if we want to make further progress on the

78
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:07,219
follow of E then we need to figure out what's in the follow of X. So, let's focus

79
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:11,280
on that for a minute. So, where's X used in the grammar, well it's used in only one

80
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,099
place and that's here, Okay? Where it appears at the right end of a production.

81
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:21,449
And what, and so therefore, the symbol on the left hand side will be a subset of the

82
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:28,449
follow set of X. So we're gonna know that the follow of E is a subset of the follow

83
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:36,099
of X. Alright? And what does that mean? Well, so follow of X is a subset of follow

84
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:40,090
of E. And follow of E is a subset of the follow of X. So that really means that

85
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:44,830
these two sets are equal. The follow of X and the follow of E, whatever they wind up

86
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:50,099
being, are gonna have to be the same set. And now we've looked at all the places

87
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:54,349
where E is used in the grammar. We've looked at all the places where X is used

88
00:07:54,349 --> 00:08:00,509
in the grammar. We can't learn anything more about what is in the sets, the follow

89
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:05,749
sets of E and X. We're not forced to add anything else, to either set, and so we're

90
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:10,599
done. And so we can close off this set. And we know the follow of E consists of

91
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:17,599
dollar sign and closed paren. And we also know that X. Has the same set, the same

92
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:25,319
follow set. Alright, so now let's move on to the follow of T, All right. So what's

93
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:34,140
going to be in the follow of T? Well we, again we have to look at where T is used

94
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:39,219
in the grammar. So T is used in two places. The first one is here in the first

95
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:43,849
production. And so what's going to be in the follow of T? Well it could be anything

96
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:49,240
that is in the first of X. Okay? Cuz X comes immediately after T. And if you

97
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:53,320
recall from the previous video, there were only two things in the first of X. One was

98
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,870
plus. So this plus is definitely in the follow of T and let's just review. [cough]

99
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:05,870
Excuse me. How that can happen, so we can go from E. To TX, okay? I'm using the

100
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,730
first production. And now we see the X comes after the T. And then in one more

101
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:17,070
step, we can go to T plus E. And now we have a derivation where plus follows T.

102
00:09:17,070 --> 00:09:23,320
And that's how we, that's, that's Y pluses in the follow of T. Alright? So the other

103
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,589
thing that was in the first of X was epsilon, because there's an epsilon

104
00:09:26,589 --> 00:09:32,040
production for X over here. But remember that we're not interested in, we don't

105
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:38,709
include epsilon in follow sets. And so X doesn't contribute anything else, to the,

106
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:43,850
to the follow of T. But since X can go to epsilon, remember what that means. That

107
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,870
means that over here, looking back at this first use of T again in the grammar, this

108
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:54,079
X can disappear. Right and that means that anything it is in the follow of E is also

109
00:09:54,079 --> 00:09:59,399
in the follow of T. Now we already know the follow of E. So we can just add those

110
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,089
things in. Okay? And let me write that down over here, just so that we don't

111
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:09,579
forget it. So, to follow. Of, of E is a subset of the follow of T. We won't really

112
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:15,320
need this fact again but, useful to write it down, perhaps. Alright and now we are

113
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:19,130
done with this use of x. We've included everything implied by this production that

114
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:25,360
we can in the follow of T and so now have to look at the other place where T is used

115
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,899
and that's over here. Okay, and so here we're going to see that T is in the right

116
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:36,600
end of a production, so anything that is in the follow Y can also be in the follow

117
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:43,600
of T, alright? So the follow of Y. Is going to be a subset of the follow of T,

118
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:51,440
alright. So now we can go off and work on the follow of Y. We have to in order to

119
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,760
figure out what the follow of T is going to be, we're gonna have to know the follow

120
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:58,620
of Y. So where is Y used in the grammar? Well there is only one place and that's

121
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,680
over here. And also Y appears in the right hand of production which means that the

122
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:09,310
left hand side symbol it's follow set will be included in the follow of Y. >> And so

123
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:16,310
the follow of t will be a subset of the follow of y. All right? And now again, we

124
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:20,570
have two follow sets that are subsets of each other. Follow of y is a subset of

125
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,480
follow of t, and follow of t is a subset of follow of y. And so these two sets, we

126
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:32,480
know are going to have to be equal. Okay? So we can write down here. At the follow

127
00:11:33,079 --> 00:11:40,079
of Y, includes plus, dollar, enclose parette. Just like the follow of T. And

128
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:46,019
now we're done. We've, we've, follow of T, and follow of Y. We've followed all the

129
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:52,360
implications of, how the follow of T gets things into, what can be included in the

130
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:57,100
follow of T. We've worked out all the places where Y is used in the grammar, and

131
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:03,779
added all the things that we can, based on, it's context. And there's nothing more

132
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:08,649
that we're forced to add either said. So we can go ahead and close these sets off.

133
00:12:08,649 --> 00:12:15,649
They're finished, Alright. So now We've done the follow of E, X, T, and Y. So

134
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:19,740
we've taken care of all the terminal symbols. But, I'm sorry, All the

135
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:23,730
non-terminal symbols. But we still need to compute the follow sets for the terminal

136
00:12:23,730 --> 00:12:28,440
symbols. And unlike the case with first sets, the follow sets for terminal symbols

137
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,940
can actually be interesting. So let's take a look, at the follow of open paren. Okay,

138
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:39,529
what can follow an open paren in a derivation? Well open paren is only used

139
00:12:39,529 --> 00:12:44,670
in one places. It's here. Okay. And so, what can follow in open parens is whatever

140
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:51,170
is in the first of E. And remember that the first of E, was the same as the first

141
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:55,920
of T, because T always produces something in the first position. And the first of T

142
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:02,720
was what? It was open paren. An int, 'kay? And if you think about this for a minute,

143
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,149
this makes complete sense. What can come after an at any valid, at any valid string

144
00:13:08,149 --> 00:13:12,579
in this grammar, while it's going to be another nested parenthize expression, or

145
00:13:12,579 --> 00:13:16,389
is it going to be an integer. In particular, you couldn't have a times or a

146
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:20,889
plus immediately after an and you couldn't absolutely have the end of the input, you

147
00:13:20,889 --> 00:13:25,660
couldn't have the input stop after an and have a valid string. So now let's take a

148
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:32,660
look at the follow of. Okay? So what's in that set? Again, we look at where the

149
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:38,269
symbol is used. It's only used here, in this one production. So and, because it

150
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:41,050
appears at the right end of the production, we know that whatever is in

151
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:46,910
the follow of T is going to be in the follow of ), all right. And so what was in

152
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:53,910
the follow of T, [cough], that was +$), Okay. So, now let's move on and take a

153
00:13:57,779 --> 00:14:04,779
look at the operators. Let's look at the follow of plus. So where's plus used?

154
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:10,779
Well, it's only used here. So whatever's in the first of E is going to be in the

155
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:16,069
follow of plus. And we already know what the first of E was. That was an open

156
00:14:16,069 --> 00:14:23,069
[inaudible], An int, Okay. And remember also that E cannot go to Epsilon. So, E

157
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:29,120
cannot ever disappear completely because T always produces at least one terminal.

158
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,139
Therefore, only the things that are in the first of year in the follow of plus.

159
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:39,170
Because E can't go to Epsilon, we only have to include the things that are in the

160
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,690
first of E, in the follow of plus. Again, if you think about it for a minute this

161
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:45,829
makes complete sense. What could come after a plus? Well, it could be an

162
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:50,470
integer, the second argument to an addition, or it could be the beginning of

163
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:55,370
another nested expression. And it couldn't be a times. It certainly couldn't be the

164
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:02,329
end of the input cuz you always have to have an argument after the plus. And, >>

165
00:15:02,329 --> 00:15:09,329
And I think that's it. I think that's all the other possibilities. >> Okay, Alright.

166
00:15:11,509 --> 00:15:16,790
Now let's take a look at the follow of times. What can come after a times. Where

167
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:21,100
is times used, it's used here. So things that are in the first of t. Are gonna be

168
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:24,519
in the follow of times again, alright? [inaudible] we already know what that is.

169
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:28,839
That's the same as the first of E. That's open paren and ints. And again, this makes

170
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:31,110
complete sense. What can come after a times? It's either the beginning of

171
00:15:31,110 --> 00:15:35,209
another [inaudible] expression or an integer. It's certainly not a plus or the

172
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:39,329
end of the input, okay? And again, T cannot go to epsilon, and so that's the

173
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:43,810
only thing. Those are the only things that can be in the follow of times. And now we

174
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:50,790
just have one more symbol to go. We have to look at the follow of an integer, of an

175
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:56,660
int. Okay, where is that used in the grammar? Well, it's right here, Alright.

176
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:59,410
So the, what's gonna be in the follow [inaudible], what 's going to include

177
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:04,699
everything in the first of Y. Okay. What's in the first of Y, well times was in the

178
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:09,370
first of Y, and epsilon was in the first of Y but remember, we don't include

179
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:16,199
epsilons in follow sets. So, Y contributes times to the follow of int. But now,

180
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:20,350
because Y could go to the epsilon and epsilon could [inaudible], that means that

181
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:25,980
this int could wind up being at the right end of this production. Okay, it could,

182
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,610
the Y could disappear and then whatever could follow the T could also follow the

183
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:35,699
int. Right, so we have to include the things in the follow of T. In the follow

184
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:41,839
of it, and what was in the follow of T where that was a plus. It was a dollar.

185
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,100
And it was a close paren, okay? And what does that tell us? Well it tells us, okay

186
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,490
for most anything to follow an int but as an open paren cannot follow an int. So you

187
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:55,690
can't have another nesit expression with a, begin right after an int without an

188
00:16:55,690 --> 00:17:01,779
intervening operator, Alright? And that completes the computation of the follow

189
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:03,040
sets for this example.
