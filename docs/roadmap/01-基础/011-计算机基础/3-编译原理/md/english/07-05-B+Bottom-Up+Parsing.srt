00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:03,389
So, to summarize, a bottom up parser traces out a

1
00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:08,420
rightmost derivation in reverse. And it builds a parse tree by combining small parse

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,990
trees into larger ones. It precedes bottom up. Instead of expanding out from the

3
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:17,300
start symbol top down, it builds from the leaves of the tree up towards the root.
