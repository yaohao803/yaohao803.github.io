Well, we've come to the end of this video. And to summarize, we looked at regular

1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:11,400
expressions, which are used to define regular languages. And the regular

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,910
expressions are syntax (that's the expression that we write down), and it

3
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,660
denotes a set of strings which is the regular language and that's the meaning of

4
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,870
the regular expression. And there are five kinds of regular expressions in the

5
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:32,439
standard definition. There's an expression for the empty string and that's denoted by

6
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:36,289
epsilon and then we have all the one character strings and then there are three

7
00:00:36,289 --> 00:00:41,890
compound expressions - ways of building new regular expressions from other regular

8
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:46,460
expressions - and these are union, concatenation, and iteration.
